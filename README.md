# Non-linear-Schrodinger-Equation---PINNs
Study of the Non-Linear Schrödinger Equation using the Split-Step Fourier Method and Physics Informed Neural Networks. Demonstrates how PDEs can be solved with Machine Learning.

UPDATE: WILL BE POLISHED AND PUSHED AFTER 09/01/26; BUSY WITH EXAMS AND WANT TO FINISH SOME THINGS BEFORE MAKING PUBLIC.
